# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Building and Deploying

The recommended way to deploy this Next.js application is by using **Vercel**, the platform created by the makers of Next.js. Vercel offers a seamless deployment experience and a generous free tier.

### Deploying with Vercel

1.  **Push to a Git Repository**: Make sure your project code is on a Git provider like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
2.  **Sign up on Vercel**: Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup) using your Git account.
3.  **Import Project**: From your Vercel dashboard, click "Add New... > Project".
4.  **Select Your Repository**: Find and select the Git repository for this project.
5.  **Deploy**: Vercel will automatically detect that you are using Next.js and configure the build settings for you. Click the "Deploy" button.

That's it! Vercel will build and deploy your application, providing you with a live URL once it's done.
