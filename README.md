# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Building and Deploying

### Building the Application

To create a production-ready version of your app, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run build
```
This will compile your Next.js application and prepare all the necessary assets.

### Deploying to Firebase App Hosting

Once your application is built, you can deploy it to Firebase. Make sure you are logged into your Firebase account.

To deploy your application, run:
```bash
firebase deploy
```

This command will upload your built application to Firebase App Hosting. Once the deployment is complete, the CLI will provide you with the URL to your live application.
